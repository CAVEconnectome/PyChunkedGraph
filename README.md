The PyChunkedGraph is a proofreading and segmentation data management backend powering FlyWire and other proofreading platforms. It builds on an initial agglomeration of supervoxels and facilitates fast and parallel editing of connected components in the agglomeration graph by many users.

## PyChunkedGraph versions

The main branch represents the second version (v2) of the PyChunkedGraph implementation. The first version (v1) is still maintained and can be found under `pcgv1`. The v2 implementation resolved data storage concerns and removed some scaling bottlenecks in the implementation. Any new dataset should use the v2. 

## Using the PyChunkedGraph

The ChunkedGraph is built on Google Cloud BigTable. A BigTable instance is required to use this ChunkedGraph implementation. 

### Environmental Variables
There are three environmental variables that need to be set
to connect to a chunkgraph:

- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Location of the google-secret.json file.
- `BIGTABLE_PROJECT`: Name of the Google Cloud project name.
- BIGTABLE_INSTANCE`: Name of the Bigtable Instance ID. (Default is 'pychunkedgraph')
- 
### Ingest 

`/ingest` provides examples for ingest scripts. The ingestion pipeline designed to use the output of the seunglab's agglomeration pipeline but can be adjusted to use alternative data sources. 

### Deployment / Import

The PyChunkedGraph can be locally deployed (`run_dev.py`), imported in a python script (`from pychunkedgraph.backend import chunkedgraph`) or deployed on a kubernetes server. Deployment code for a kubernetes server on Google Cloud is not included in this repository. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in that. 

## System Design

As a backend the PyChunkedGraph can be combined with any frontend that adheres to its API. We use an adapted version of [neuroglancer](https://github.com/seung-lab/neuroglancer/tree/nkem-multicut) which is publicly available.
